# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of Project
- The purpose of this analysis is to help Jacks PlanMyTrip app get more data from the changes requested by the Beta testers.
	* The first request is to use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences so that the client can get potential travel destinations
	* From the list of potential travel destinations, the client will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary.
	* Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, you will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
	
## Results
- The results for each request are shown by the pngs below.
